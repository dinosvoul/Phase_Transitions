The current file provides a short description about the content of the current
folder. In order to run the multiprocessing.py script it is necessary to download the 
pyunlocbox for python. Download link:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyunlocbox

1) multiprocessing.py. The current python script corresponds to the first 
stage of the framework which solves l_1 minimization problem.

2) phase_transitions.py. The current pythonn script corresponds to the 
second stage of the framework which develops the Logistic Regression Model

3) polytope. The current matlab file containts the tabulated values of the
 regular polytopes.

4) read_test_broaden_range.py. The current python script reads the results
stored in testbroadenrange.hdf5 and then compares the phase transitions 
extracted by theLogistic Regression Model versus the  upper and lower bound 
of the phase transitions based on the cross polytopes.


5) report. The current PDF contains the worksheets from the 8th semester 
project of group 15gr870. 

6) testbroadenrange.hdf5 . The current hdf5 file contains the results from
 the experiment for N=1000.
